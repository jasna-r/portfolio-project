        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        I am freshly certified Front-End developer.
        Just finished the Academy for Coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously I was learning from online courses for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, especially when the pandemic started.
          </p>
          <p> A year ago I decided that I genuinely want to expand my knowledge and in fact coding to become my occupation in the near future.
        So, I signed up at CodeAcademy in Skopje.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the same time I was working my full time job and constantly learning.
        Gained knowledge for the technologies I have mentioned in the skills section.
        </p>
        <p>
        And here I am now, willing to change my carreer. 
        </p>
        <p>
        So, please, take a look at some of my work, bellow I have some of my Github links.
        </p>
